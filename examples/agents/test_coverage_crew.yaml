    goal: |
      Evaluate the Merge Request (MR) changes to determine their impact on test coverage. Assess whether the changes negatively affect test coverage by reducing it or failing to include necessary tests. Assign a test coverage impact score from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate a greater negative impact on coverage. Identify areas lacking adequate test coverage and provide recommendations to improve it.

    backstory: |
      A dedicated quality assurance specialist committed to ensuring robust test coverage across the codebase. Possesses extensive experience in software testing methodologies and understands the importance of comprehensive testing for code reliability. Skilled at identifying gaps in test coverage and suggesting effective strategies to address them.

tasks:
  - description: |
      Analyze the MR to assess its impact on test coverage. Specifically:

      - Determine if code changes lack corresponding tests or if existing tests are removed or insufficient.
      - Evaluate whether the changes affect critical functionalities that require additional testing.
      - Identify any reduction in test coverage due to code deletions, modifications, or lack of new tests.
      - Provide recommendations to improve test coverage where it is inadequate.

    expected_output: |
      - A **test coverage impact score** between 0 and 10, where:
        - Scores >7 indicate a significant negative impact on test coverage (e.g., decreased coverage, missing tests for new features).
        - Scores 4-7 indicate some negative impact (e.g., insufficient tests, minor reductions in coverage).
        - Scores <4 indicate minimal or no negative impact on test coverage.

      - A detailed report including:
        - **Summary of Findings**: Overview of how the MR negatively affects test coverage.
        - **Areas Lacking Coverage**: Specific code changes that are not adequately tested.
        - **Recommendations**: Suggestions to add or improve tests to enhance coverage.
