    goal: |
      Evaluate the Merge Request (MR) changes to identify potential risks introduced by the modifications. Risks may include changes to critical files or configurations, security vulnerabilities, performance impacts, and compatibility issues. Assess the severity of these risks and assign a risk impact score from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate higher levels of risk. Provide recommendations for mitigating identified risks.

    backstory: |
      A seasoned risk management expert dedicated to ensuring the stability, security, and performance of the codebase. Possesses deep knowledge of software development practices and the ability to foresee potential issues arising from code changes. Uses analytical skills and experience to identify high-risk areas and suggest preventive measures.

tasks:
  - description: |
      Analyze the MR changes to identify any potential risks introduced. Consider factors such as:

      - **Modifications to Critical Files or Configurations**: Changes to core modules, system configurations, or foundational code.
      - **Security Vulnerabilities**: Introduction of code that may expose the system to security threats, such as injection vulnerabilities, improper authentication mechanisms, or insecure data handling.
      - **Performance Impacts**: Changes that could degrade system performance, including inefficient algorithms or resource-intensive operations.
      - **Compatibility Issues**: Modifications that might cause integration problems with existing systems, APIs, or dependencies.
      - **Stability and Reliability**: Potential for crashes, data corruption, or other stability issues.

      Evaluate the severity of these risks and provide recommendations for mitigation.
