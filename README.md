Sage enables you to communicate with your data in a natural and intuitive way. Whether you're looking up information, summarizing content, or integrating with external tools, Sage is your personal data assistant, ready to help.

## Key Features

CodeSage aims to be a fully-fledged Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) capable of autonomously working in a software development capacity. While the ultimate goal is ambitious, the current objectives of CodeSage are to:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Engage with Sage in everyday language to perform data-related tasks.
- **Configuration Simplicity**: Set up Sage quickly by specifying your desired tools and sources in a configuration file.
- **Diverse Tool Integration**: Leverage a suite of integrated tools for a variety of functions, from calculations to web searches.
- **Agent Capabilities**: Utilize Sage in agent mode for advanced tasks, including code assistance and debugging.

In Agent mode, sage could perform specific actions autonomously, such as:

- Creating Merge Requests (MRs) to fix bugs.
- Managing Jira tickets by analyzing content and determining appropriate actions.

## Current Implementation

Sage currently offers the following functionalities:

- **Data Source Queries**: Interact with multiple data sources directly through conversational prompts.
- **Integrated Tools**: Access tools like calculators, search engines, and Jira issue summarizers within the chat.
- **Autonomous Agent Mode**: Activate Sage as an AI agent to handle complex queries and perform autonomous actions.
