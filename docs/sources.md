# Data Sources Overview for Sage

Sage can connect to various data sources to retrieve and manipulate data. This document outlines the data sources currently supported and how to configure them.

## List of Supported Data Sources

- **Databases**: Connect to SQL and NoSQL databases.
- **APIs**: Integrate with RESTful APIs for data retrieval.
- **File Systems**: Access data stored in local or cloud-based file systems.

## Configuring Data Sources

To configure a data source in Sage:

1. Add the data source details to your `config.toml` file, including connection strings, authentication credentials, and any other necessary parameters.
2. Restart Sage to apply the new configuration.

## Using Data Sources

Once configured, you can ask Sage to perform actions related to the data source, such as:

- Querying a database for specific records.
- Fetching data from an API endpoint.
- Reading or writing files to a file system.

For more detailed instructions on setting up and using each data source, please refer to the specific sections below.
