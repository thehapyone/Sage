# Large Language Models (LLMs) Supported by Sage

Sage leverages the power of Large Language Models to provide accurate and context-aware responses. Here's a list of the LLMs currently supported:

## Supported LLMs

- **OpenAI's GPT Models**: Utilize models like GPT-3 for generating human-like text.
- **Hugging Face Models**: Access a wide range of models from the Hugging Face community.

## Interacting with LLMs

To interact with an LLM through Sage:

1. Send a query that the LLM is configured to respond to.
2. Sage will process the query using the appropriate LLM and return a response.

## Configuring LLMs

Ensure you have the necessary API keys and tokens set up in your `.env` file and `config.toml`. For each LLM, specify the settings such as model type, API endpoint, and any other relevant parameters.

## Best Practices

- Provide enough context in your queries to get the most accurate responses.
- Be aware of the limitations and usage costs associated with each LLM.

For more detailed information on each LLM, including setup and usage examples, please refer to the sections below.
