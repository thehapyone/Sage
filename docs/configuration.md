# Configuration Guide for Sage

This document provides detailed instructions on how to configure the Sage application to suit your specific needs and environment. Sage uses a TOML configuration file to manage various settings and preferences.

## Starters Configuration

Configuring starters is straightforward and requires editing a YAML configuration file. Each starter consists of a user-friendly label, a pre-defined message that sets the context or action for the AI, an optional icon to visually represent the action, and an optional source identifier that specifies the context for the message.

Here's how you can configure starters:

1. Open the `starters.yaml` file in your code editor.
2. Define each starter with the following attributes:
   - `label`: A short, descriptive name for the quick-action prompt.
   - `message`: The initial message or command that the starter will send to Sage.
   - `icon`: A URL to an image that will appear as an icon for the starter in the UI.
   - `source`: (Optional) A string that denotes the source to be concatenated with the `message` when sent to Sage.

Starters are configured via a yaml file that is set in the sage config.toml file under the core section like below

```toml
[core]
...
starters_path = "/path/to/starters.yaml"
...
```

### Example Starters Configuration

Below is an example of how starters can be configured in the `starters.yaml` file:

```yaml
starters:
  - label: "Casual Wedding Invite"
    message: "Draft a casual message to invite a friend as my guest to a wedding next month, ensuring it feels light-hearted and stress-free."
    icon: "https://picsum.photos/200"
  - label: "Superconductors Simplified"
    message: "Describe superconductors in a way that a five-year-old could understand."
    icon: "https://picsum.photos/300"
    source: "Confluence: SF Space Details"
  - label: "Python Email Automation Script"
    message: "Generate a Python script for automating daily email reports."
    icon: "https://picsum.photos/400"
    source: "Confluence: Development Docs"
```
When the user selects a starter, the message (concatenated with the source, if provided) is sent to Sage, triggering the respective action or query as if the user had typed the message themself.

## Configuration File

The primary way to configure Sage is through a `config.toml` file located in the root directory of the application. This file contains various sections that correspond to different parts of the application, such as core settings, source connections, and model configurations.

Path to the configuration file `config.toml` can be set via the environment variable `SAGE_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config.toml`

### Core Configuration

The `[core]` section of the configuration file specifies the fundamental settings of the application, such as the data directory and logging level.

```toml
[core]
data_dir = "/path/to/data/directory"
logging_level = "INFO" # Can be DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, or CRITICAL
user_agent = "Sage.ai"
starters_path = "/path/to/starters.yaml"
```

## Upload Configuration

The [upload] section defines the settings related to file uploads, such as maximum file size and upload timeout.
```toml
[upload]
max_size_mb = 10
max_files = 5
timeout = 300
```

## Jira Configuration

The [jira] section configures the connection to your Jira instance, including the URL, user credentials, and polling interval.

```toml
[jira]
url = "https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/"
username = "your_jira_username"
polling_interval = 300
project = "YOURPROJECT"
status_todo = "To Do"
```

## Source Configuration

The [source] section allows you to configure various data sources that Sage can interact with, such as Confluence, GitLab, web links, and files.

```toml
[source]
# The number of documents to retrieve from the retriever system
top_k = 10
# Schedule in cron format: minute, hour, day (month), month, day (week)  
# Example: "0 * * * *" means every hour at the 0th minute  
refresh_schedule = "0 0 * * SUN" # Every Sunday at midnight  

[source.confluence]
username = "your_confluence_username"
server = "https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/wiki"
spaces = ["SPACE1", "SPACE2"]

[source.gitlab]
server = "https://gitlab.com"
groups = ["group1", "group2"]
projects = ["project1", "project2"]

[source.web]
links = ["https://example.com", "https://anotherexample.com"]
nested = true
ssl_verify = true
# Adds an optional Basic Auth for the web links. E.g Directory listing servers
username = "username"
password = "password"

[source.files]
paths = ["/path/to/file1", "/path/to/file2"]
```

## Embeddings and LLM Configuration

The [embedding] and [llm] sections configure the embedding engines and Large Language Models (LLMs) used by Sage

```toml
[llm]
model = "gpt-4-turbo"

[embedding]
type = "huggingface"
model = "jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en"
```

## Environment Variables for Sensitive Credentials

For security reasons, it is crucial to avoid storing sensitive credentials such as passwords and API keys directly in the configuration file. Instead, Sage is designed to retrieve these credentials from environment variables.

The `validator.py` file contains logic to fall back to environment variables if a password is not provided in the `config.toml` file. This approach allows you to keep sensitive information secure.

To set an environment variable, you can use the following commands in your terminal:

For Unix-based systems (Linux/macOS):

```shell
export CONFLUENCE_PASSWORD="your_confluence_password"
export GITLAB_PASSWORD="your_gitlab_password"
export JIRA_PASSWORD="your_jira_password"
# ... and so on for other services
```

For Windows:

```shell
set CONFLUENCE_PASSWORD=your_confluence_password
set GITLAB_PASSWORD=your_gitlab_password
set JIRA_PASSWORD=your_jira_password
# ... and so on for other services
```

Make sure to replace `your_confluence_password`, `your_gitlab_password`, and `your_jira_password` with your actual credentials.

After setting the environment variables, Sage will automatically use these values when the corresponding fields in the config.toml file are left empty.

## Finalizing Configuration

Once you have edited the `config.toml` file and set the necessary environment variables, save the file and restart the **Sage** application to apply the changes.

For more information on the specific fields and acceptable values in the configuration file, please refer to the inline documentation within the [validator.py](../sage/utils/validator.py) file or the sample [config.toml](../sage/config.toml) provided with the application.
